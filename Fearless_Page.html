    <q>Fearless was an album full of magic and curiosity, the bliss and devastation of youth. It was the diary of the adventures and explorations [of] a teenage girl who was learning tiny lessons with every new crack in the facade of the fairytale ending she'd been shown in the movies.
        </q>— Swift reflecting on Fearless in 2021
    </p>
    
   <p class= "fw-normal fs-6 lh-sm text-center px-3 py-1">
    Taylor Swift released her second studio album, Fearless, on November 11, 2008 to critical and commercial success. It was distributed by American record label Big Machine. The country pop effort spent 11 weeks atop the US Billboard 200 chart and became the best-selling album of 2009. It spawned five top-10 entries on the Billboard Hot 100, including the crossover singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me", and catapulted Swift to mainstream prominence. The most awarded country album in history, Fearless won four Grammy Awards at the 52nd ceremony, including Album of the Year, the first of Swift's three wins in that category. The album was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America, and is credited for paving Swift's way to becoming one of the biggest acts of her generation.
    </p>
    
   <p class= "fw-normal fs-6 lh-sm text-center px-3 py-1">
    In 2018, having recorded six studio albums under Big Machine, Swift's contract with the label expired. She signed a new contract with record label Republic Records, which is a division of Universal Music Group. In 2019, Big Machine Records was acquired by American talent manager and businessman Scooter Braun and his company Ithaca Holdings. As part of the acquisition, ownership of the masters to Swift's first six studio albums, including Fearless, transferred to Braun. The master is the first recording of an audio recording, from which copies are made for sales and distribution; the owner of the master, therefore, owns all copies, such as digital versions for download or on streaming platforms, or physical versions available on CDs and vinyl records. In August 2019, Swift denounced the purchase, and announced her intention to re-record her first six studio albums so as to own their masters. In November 2020, Braun sold the masters to Shamrock Holdings, an American private equity firm owned by the Disney estate, under the terms of acquisition that Braun and Ithaca Holdings will continue to benefit from the albums financially.

    <h3 class="h2 fw-bold fs-2 text-center text-danger-emphasis">Song From "The Vault"</h3>
    
    <p class= "fw-normal fs-6 lh-sm text-center px-3 py-1">
    Tracks 21 through 26 are branded as "From the Vault", which are songs that did not make the final cut of Fearless (2008). "You All Over Me" is an acoustic country pop song with soaring fiddles, lilting guitars, harmonica, pulsing synth drums, hushed percussions, and Morris' backing vocals. Lyrically, the track details not being able to get over a former lover, while trying to find acceptance and peace. Driven by energetic guitars and drums, "Mr. Perfectly Fine" is a midtempo country pop and pop rock song with elements of rock and rock and roll. Its lyrics find Swift navigating the tumultuous feelings ensued post-breakup, using witty wordplay. The song contains the line "Mr. casually cruel", which has been associated with Swift's 2012 song "All Too Well".
    </p>
    
    <p class= "fw-normal fs-6 lh-sm text-center px-3 py-1">
    The slow-paced "We Were Happy" is about reminiscing over the highest points of a derailed relationship. Its minimal instrumentals incorporate strings, a chiming guitar riff and lush harmonies. "That's When" is a duet with Urban, marking Swift's second collaboration with him, after "Highway Don't Care" (2012). The song is about two past lovers reuniting. It is a "woozy" country-pop tune with euphoric layered vocals, giddy harmonies, and 1989-style production. In the sparse "Don't You", the narrator runs into a former lover, and pines for their past relationship. Its production incorporates keyboards, electric guitars, and drums layered over each other. "Bye Bye Baby", originally titled "One Thing", was an unreleased track that had existed in the internet for a long time. Swift re-recorded the song for Fearless (Taylor's Version) and changed its title. The song concludes the album with a notion of "Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side", a possible reference to Swift's masters dispute.
    </p>
    
    <h3 class="h2 fw-bold fs-2 text-center text-danger-emphasis">Awards and Nomanations</h3>
    
    <p>Swift pulled Fearless (Taylor’s Version) from contending for Grammy Awards and Country Music Association (CMA) Awards. On July 20, 2021, a Republic Records representative explained to Billboard that Swift will not submit the album to any of the categories, since "Fearless has already won four Grammys including album of the year, as well as the CMA Award for album of the year in 2009/2010 and remains the most awarded country album of all time." Nevertheless, Fearless (Taylor's Version) was nominated for Top Country Album at the 2022 Billboard Music Awards, alongside Red (Taylor's Version) in the same category; the latter won the award.
