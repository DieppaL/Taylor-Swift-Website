    After a dispute over the sale of the masters of her first six studio albums in 2019, Taylor Swift announced that she plans to re-record the said albums.[2] She released the first two of these re-recordings, Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version), in 2021.[3] The latter included the ten-minute, original version of her 2012 song "All Too Well". It was accompanied by a corresponding short film, All Too Well: The Short Film, written and directed by Swift.[4] Fans speculated that her next album would be re-recording of Speak Now (2010) or 1989 (2014).

    Swift garnered five nominations for the short film at the 2022 MTV Video Music Awards on August 28, 2022,[7] and won three of them.[8] In her acceptance speech for the Video of the Year award, she announced a "brand-new" studio album scheduled for release on October 21, 2022.[9] Shortly after, Swift's official website was updated with a clock counting down to midnight and the phrase "Meet me at midnight".[9] The canvases of some of Swift's songs on Spotify were changed to a visual featuring the clock.[10] At midnight, Swift posted across her social media accounts that her tenth studio album would be titled Midnights, accompanied by a premise. She described the album as "the stories of 13 sleepless nights scattered throughout [her] life".[9] Swift's official website crashed due to heavy traffic following the posts.
