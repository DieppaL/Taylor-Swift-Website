   Speak Now is the third studio album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, released on October 25, 2010, through Big Machine Records. Swift wrote the album entirely herself within two years, while she was promoting her second studio album Fearless (2008). Inspired by Swift's transition from adolescence into adulthood, Speak Now is a loose concept album about her confessions regarding love and heartache, with some songs about her public experiences. Produced by Swift and Nathan Chapman, the album combines country pop, pop rock, and power pop with rock sensibilities and melodies characterized by acoustic instruments, dynamic electric guitars, strings, and drums.

    After the album's release, Swift embarked on the Speak Now World Tour, which visited Asia, Europe, North America, and Oceania from February 2011 to March 2012. The album was supported by six singles, including the US Billboard Hot 100 top-ten singles "Mine" and "Back to December", and the US Hot Country Songs number ones "Sparks Fly" and "Ours". Speak Now peaked atop charts and received multi-platinum certifications in Australia (double platinum) and Canada (triple platinum). In the US, it sold one million copies within its first release week, spent six weeks at number one on the Billboard 200, and was certified six times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

    Speak Now received generally positive reviews from music critics for offering emotional engagement and radio-friendly songs. Some critics complimented Swift's grown-up perspective, but others took issue with the songs about vengeance and heartbreak as shallow. At the 54th Annual Grammy Awards in 2012, Speak Now was nominated for Best Country Album, and its third single "Mean" won Best Country Song and Best Country Solo Performance. The album appeared in 2010s decade-end lists by Billboard and Spin, and on Rolling Stone's 2012 list of the "50 Best Female Albums of All Time". Critics have retrospectively named Speak Now one of the best country albums of the 2010s and described its songs about Swift's public image a precedent to her songwriting on subsequent albums.

    <h3>Commercail Performance</h3>

    Before Speak Now's release, Big Machine shipped two million copies of the album to stores in the US. In the week ending November 13, 2010, the album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, with first-week sales of 1,047,000 copies. It marked the highest single-week tally for a female country artist and became the first album since Lil Wayne's Tha Carter III (2008) to sell over one million copies in its first week of release. Media publications including Billboard, MTV, and The New York Times noted Speak Now's first-week sales figures in the context of declining record sales brought about by the emergence of music download platforms. According to The New York Times, although the music industry in 2010 saw album sales "[plunging] by more than 50 percent in the last decade", the album's strong sales proved Swift "has transcended the limitations of genre and become a pop megastar". The Guinness World Records in 2010 recognized Speak Now as the fastest-selling album in the US by a female country artist.

    In Speak Now's first charting week, 11 of the standard edition's 14 tracks charted on the Billboard Hot 100, making Swift the first female artist to have 11 songs on the Hot 100 at the same time. After the digital release of the deluxe edition tracks in November 2011, "If This Was a Movie" charted at number 10 on the Hot 100, making Swift the first artist to have eight songs debut in the top 10. With this achievement, Speak Now had three songs peaking in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100â€”"Mine", "Back to December", and "If This Was a Movie". The album spent six non-consecutive weeks atop the Billboard 200. Speak Now was the third-best-selling album of 2010 in the US with sales of 2,960,000 copies. By October 2020, it had sold 4,710,000 copies in the US. The RIAA certified the album six-times platinum, denoting six million album-equivalent units based on sales, song downloads, and streaming.
