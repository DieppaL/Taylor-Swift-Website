    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p><q>
    My world felt opened up creatively. There was a point that I got to as a writer who only wrote very diaristic songs that I felt it was unsustainable for my future moving forward. So what I felt after we put out Folklore was like "oh wow, people are into this too, this thing that feels really good for my life and feels really good for my creativity… it feels good for them too?" </q>— Swift on how Folklore changed her creative process moving forward, Apple Music 1

    During the COVID-19 lockdowns, on July 23, 2020, American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift announced her eighth studio album and first surprise album, Folklore, and released it the next day. Produced by herself, first-time collaborator Aaron Dessner, long-time collaborator Jack Antonoff, and boyfriend Joe Alwyn, the album was a critical and commercial success, becoming the best-selling album of 2020 and winning Album of the Year at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards.[2] On November 25, 2020, a concert documentary titled Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions, shot at Dessner's Long Pond Studio in Hudson Valley, was released to Disney+. It detailed the making of Folklore with performances of its songs.

    After releasing Folklore, Swift continued to work remotely with Dessner, who would send her instrumental tracks, to which she would write the lyrics.[5] She stated the rave reception of Folklore further encouraged her to experiment further with its musical style.[1] Soon after, Swift's sessions with Dessner resulted in a project that was a natural extension of Folklore,[5] which eventually assumed its individual identity as Evermore. Dessner dubbed Evermore a "weird avalanche" effecting from Folklore.[6] In comparison to its predecessor, the development of Evermore was a more experimental process, during which the duo did not subject themselves to any limitations.[5] In an Apple Music interview to Zane Lowe, Swift stated Evermore gave her a feeling of "quiet conclusion and sort of this weird serenity" after putting out Folklore,[1] and correlated it with the themes of those albums, saying one of Folklore's main tropes was "conflict resolution"—"trying to figure out how to get through something with someone", whereas Evermore deals with "endings of all sorts, sizes and shapes", and the pain and various phases of those closures.

    On December 10, 2020, three days prior to her 31st birthday, Swift posted nine photos on Instagram, which together formed an image depicting the singer's back, with her hair in a braid and facing a forest. In another post across her social media, she announced her ninth studio album, titled Evermore, releasing at midnight. She revealed the track-list, and a music video for its opening track, "Willow", which would premiere on YouTube alongside the album release.[4][3] Referring to lockdown regulations in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, Swift wrote: "You've all been so caring, supportive and thoughtful on my birthdays and so this time I thought I would give you something! I also know this holiday season will be a lonely one for most of us and if there are any of you out there who turn to music to cope with missing loved ones the way I do, this is for you".[3] Prior to the "Willow" music video premiere, Swift said she likens Evermore to fall and winter, in contrast to its predecessor's spring and summer.

    <h3>Commercail Performance</h3>

    Available only via digital music and streaming platforms,[101] Republic Records reported over a million copies of Evermore sold in its first-week worldwide, marking Swift's eighth consecutive studio album to achieve it.[102] All of the album's 15 tracks entered the top 75 of the Billboard Global 200 chart.[103] Aided by Evermore and Folklore, Swift was 2020's top streamed artist on Amazon Music across all genres.[104] The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) named her the best-selling solo artist and female artist of 2020, and second overall.

    <h3>Accolades</h3>
    <p>
    Journalists praised Swift's fast-succeeding release of Evermore after Folklore. Variety compared it to similar moves by the Beatles[93] and U2,[24] while Rolling Stone termed it a "hot streak" reminiscent of Prince in 1987 and David Bowie in 1977.[98] Vulture called it a "major shock", as Swift is known for her traditional album roll-outs.[67] Our Culture Mag and NJ.com welcomed her "artistic dedication", as Swift was also concurrently re-recording her back catalog in 2020.[90][91] The Sydney Morning Herald named her "the queen of pandemic productivity".[149] The New York Times felt the album was as a crucial moment in Swift's career and creativity.[69] The Guardian and Vox opined that Evermore and Folklore threw emphasis on Swift's work ethic, helped critics recognize her musicianship and view her as a dedicated songstress, moving away from her popstar image in the mid-2010s.[150][151] Billboard cited the two albums as the most notable examples for how the pandemic veered music in 2020, and forced artists to amend their creative process.[152] CNN and The Times named Swift among the most prominent celebrities of the pandemic.[153][154] Swift was the world's top paid solo musician of 2020,[155] and the highest paid in the US, thanks to her revenues from Evermore and Folklore,[156] which according to Junkee were "alternative experiments" taken mainstream by Swift's "sheer star power".

    At the 2021 American Music Awards, Evermore won the American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Album, as Swift's record-breaking seventh nod and fourth win in the category. Swift was also nominated for Artist of the Year and Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist, and won the latter for a record-breaking sixth time.[158][159] At the 64th Annual Grammy Awards, Evermore contended for Album of the Year as Swift's fifth nomination in the category, following Fearless (2008), Red (2012), 1989 (2014) and Folklore.

    Croatian singer-songwriter Mia Dimšić named Evermore as an inspiration for writing "Guilty Pleasure", her entry song representing Croatia at the Eurovision Song Contest 2022.[161][162] American singer-songwriter Christina Perri, regarding her 2022 single "Evergone", told Consequence that Evermore and Folklore influenced her to write heartfelt, melancholic songs as opposed to external expectations for upbeat music.[163] After Evermore, artists such as Gracie Abrams, Ed Sheeran, King Princess and Girl in Red collaborated with Dessner at his Long Pond Studio. Dessner stated, "After Taylor, it was a bit crazy how many people reached out. And getting to meet and write songs with people you wouldn't have had access to... I'm so grateful for it.
