    <p class= "fw-normal fs-6 lh-sm text-center px-2 py-1">
    <q>Musically and lyrically, Red resembled a heartbroken person. It was all over the place, a fractured mosaic of feelings that somehow all fit together in the end. Happy, free, confused, lonely, devastated, euphoric, wild, and tortured by memories past. Like trying on pieces of a new life, I went into the studio and experimented with different sounds and collaborators. And I'm not sure if it was pouring my thoughts into this album, hearing thousands of your voices sing the lyrics back to me in passionate solidarity, or if it was simply time, but something was healed along the way.</q>— Swift looking back on Red on her social media 
    </p>
    
    <p class= "fw-normal fs-6 lh-sm text-center px-2 py-1">
    Taylor Swift's fourth studio album, Red, was released on October 22, 2012, by American independent record label Big Machine Records. It witnessed Swift expand beyond her country roots and explore mainstream pop, incorporating a variety of genres. The effort was met with generally positive reviews and widespread commercial success. It garnered Swift's first number-one song on the US Billboard Hot 100, the album's lead single "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together", and other successful singles in 2012 and 2013, such as "I Knew You Were Trouble", "22" and "Everything Has Changed". Red became Swift's first number-one album in the UK, and her album with the most UK top-10 singles so far. Over the years, the album collected critical praise for showcasing Swift's artistry and versatility. It became one of the most acclaimed albums of the 2010s decade, appearing on many decade-end best-music lists. Rolling Stone placed it at number 99 on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. As of June 2021, Red has moved over 7.5 million album-equivalent units in the US alone.
    </p>
    
   <p class= "fw-normal fs-6 lh-sm text-center px-2 py-1">
    As per her contract with Big Machine, Swift released six studio albums under the label from 2006 to 2017. In late 2018, the contract with the label expired; she hence withdrew from Big Machine and signed a new recording deal with Republic Records, a division of Universal Music Group, which secured her the rights to own the masters of the new music she will release. In 2019, American businessman Scooter Braun and his company Ithaca Holdings acquired Big Machine. As part of the acquisition, ownership of the masters to Swift's first six studio albums, including Red, transferred to Braun. In August 2019, Swift denounced Braun's purchase of the label, and announced that she would re-record her first six studio albums, so as to own their masters herself. In November 2020, Braun sold the masters to Shamrock Holdings, an American private equity firm owned by the Disney estate, under the conditions that Braun and Ithaca Holdings will continue to financially profit from the albums. Swift began re-recording the albums in November 2020.

    <h3 class="h2 fw-bold fs-2 text-center text-warning text-opacity-75">Song From "The Vault"</h3>
    
   <p class= "fw-normal fs-6 lh-sm text-center px-2 py-1">
    "Better Man" is a banjo-led country ballad that incorporates mandolin and strings with lyrics about the aftermath of a painful breakup. "Nothing New" is a folk duet with Phoebe Bridgers, with lyrics dealing with insecurities around aging, and the "unfair social expectations on young women". "Babe" is a ska pop song with slide guitar, keyboards, brass, and percussion. Its lyrics describe the missteps in a dissolving relationship.
    </p>
    <p class= "fw-normal fs-6 lh-sm text-center px-2 py-1">
    "Message in a Bottle" is an upbeat dance-pop track about the beginnings of a romantic connection. "I Bet You Think About Me" is a country pop song featuring background vocals by Chris Stapleton, and a prominent harmonica. It has tongue-in-cheek lyrics deriding an ex-lover's luxurious and pretentious lifestyle. "Forever Winter" is a power pop song opening with energetic brass. Swift's vocals in the song are characterized by "nuanced, wide-ranging", fast-paced, breathy notes of syllables, set to horns, flutes, and guitars. Lyrically, "Forever Winter" is directed to a friend of Swift with mental health struggles.
    </p>
    <p class= "fw-normal fs-6 lh-sm text-center px-2 py-1">
    "Run" is an acoustic, indie folk-leaning duet with Ed Sheeran.It is guided by a twiddling guitar and orchestral compositions, while its lyrics consist of romantic gestures. "The Very First Night" is an uptempo dance-pop song driven by electronic programming and banjo in which Swift wishes she could go back in time to make a moment perfect. "All Too Well (10-Minute Version)", Swift's longest song in her entire discography, is a slow ballad driven by a thudding and insistent bass guitar, and additional verses, chorus with a downtempo outro. Its lyrics take a more feminist proposition compared to the five-minute version, and incorporates the popular William Shakespeare quote "All's Well That Ends Well".
    </p>
