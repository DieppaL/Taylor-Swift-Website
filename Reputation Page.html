    American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, who had identified as a country musician, released her fifth studio album, 1989, in October 2014.With 1989's synth-pop production, Swift departed from the country-music scene to embrace mainstream pop. The album received generally positive reviews and transformed Swift's status to that of a pop icon. It sold 10 million copies worldwide and its accompanying world tour was the highest-grossing of 2015. The album's singles, including three US Billboard Hot 100 chart toppers, dominated US airplay for over a year and a half, which Billboard described as "a kind of cultural omnipresence that's rare for a 2010s album".

    <p>
    Swift's rising popularity with 1989 turned her into a fixation onto which the media imposed questions regarding cultural issues of race, gender, and politics. Her "girl squad" of female celebrity friends including fashion models, actresses, and singers, received backlash for allegedly promoting a false idea of feminism which The Daily Telegraph remarked as "impossibly beautiful women flaunting impossibly perfect lives". Tabloid media publicized her short-lived romantic relationships with Scottish producer Calvin Harris and English actor Tom Hiddleston, and a feud with rapper Kanye West and media personality Kim Kardashian over West's song "Famous", in which he claims he made Swift a success (the lyric "I made that bitch famous" was particularly controversial). Although Swift said she never consented to the said lyric, Kardashian released a phone recording between Swift and West, in which the former seemingly consented to another portion of the song.

    After the West–Kardashian controversy, critics regarded Swift as fake and calculating, a conclusion that surmounted after years of what they saw as a deliberate maneuver to carefully cultivate her public image. Her once-reputation as "America's Sweetheart", attributed to her down-to-earth and positive image, began to fade. The tumultuous events made her a subject of an online "#IsOverParty" hashtag, where her detractors denounced her as a "snake". They overshadowed her public advocacy; the praise she received for her victory in a sexual assault trial, part of an ongoing public debate about sexual misconduct, had minimal impact in improving her image. Swift became increasingly reticent on social media despite a large following, and avoided the press amidst the commotion.She announced a prolonged hiatus and felt "people might need a break from [her]"

    <h3>Commercail Performance</h3>
    
    <p>
    Reputation sold two million copies worldwide within one week of release. In the US, the album sold roughly 700,000 copies after one day of availability, and 1.05 million after four days. It opened at number one on the US Billboard 200 with first-week figures of 1,238,000 album-equivalent units that consisted of 1,216,000 pure sales—more than any other albums on the chart that week combined. With the achievement, Reputation made Swift the first artist to have four albums each sell more than a million copies within one week since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991. The album spent four non-consecutive weeks at number one, was 2017's best-selling album in the US, and topped the 2018 Billboard 200 Year-End chart. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in December 2017 certified the album 3× Platinum for surpassing three million album-equivalent units. By October 2022, Reputation's US sales stood at 2.4 million.
